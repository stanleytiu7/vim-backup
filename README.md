# vim-Filebackup
My ubuntu partition blew up so I'm adding this after spending half a day fixing it. I <3 vim so I'm backing up my rc file onto github. It's my development environment of choice. I started from a blank .vimrc and added each line for subjects that I thought were important or too troublesome to do with the base vim stuff. 

## Notable Packages (must-have!!!):
I use pathogen to keep track of all my packages. As of now, this is the list I'm using:
* airline, just a lightweight powerline
* FZF, for easy file searching
* CtrlP, for easy file searching
* nerdcommenter, for easy commenting
* nerdtree, for multi-file navigation
* rainbow, for rainbow brackets
* syntastic, cuz I develop in javascript and linting is pretty much a must (ESLINT THANK YOU!!!!)
* solarized, since it really is a nice looking colorscheme, but badwolf is in there too
* vim-fugitive, to execute git commands from vim
* vim-gitgutter, to show changed lines in a file
* vim-javascript, cuz syntax highlighting is great
* vim-jsbeautify, autoformatting saves a bunch of time and sanity
* vim-jsx, for everything that jsxbeautify() can't do
* vim-polyglot, a great managed source for multilanguage development
* vim-rooter, autoset the root of a project directory (uses VCS files)
* YouCompleteMe, syntax completion but I don't use it that effectively. If you miss IDE-like tab completion it's for you though
